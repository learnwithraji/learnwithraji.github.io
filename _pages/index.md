Call me Raji. 

I am a Solutions Architect and Trainer with expertise in Cloud & Cybersecurity. I recently developed interest in embeded systems and I'm also fascinated by machine learning and its applications in cybersecurity.

Over the years, I have worked with several Microsoft technologies ranging from Windows Servers, Exchange, Active Directory, Systems Center, Forefront. In recent times, I wine and dine  Azure and Microsoft 365

## By learning you will teach, by teaching you will learn (Latin Proverb)

I learn and explore technologies within my areas of interest and I have a strong passion for teaching (hope to get into academia some day). Here I share my learinings, experiences and exploration.

Join me in the <i>learningTogether</i> sessions where with likeâ€“minded learners and also exploring new things.

You can join me in any of these [Events](https://learnwithraji.github.io/events/) or [learningTogether](https://learnwithraji.github.io/learntogether/) sessions.
